Structure

At a glance, you write your modules into scripts/app/modules. If you want to add a new dependency, add it in bower, scripts/app/boot.js, build.js

To load a module you have to way:
 - bind a route in main.js which handle the Sammy the router
 - dynamically assign module and initialData by setting

Please note that main.js module acts as a singleton and return an instance of himself, which will be passed as
the same instance if you require it in your modules.
